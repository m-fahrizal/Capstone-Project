# Capstone-Project
Create an android application called MYKIP. It is an application that is useful for facilitating the KIP-Kuliah registration selection process because this application can detect the eligibility of data submitted by scholarship applicants. The purpose of this application is expected to reduce the existence of KIP-Kuliah recipients who are not on target (only people who are economically disadvantaged).
