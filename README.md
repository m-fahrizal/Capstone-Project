# Capstone-Project
Participated in creating an android application called MYKIP.  The MyKIP project is our initiative where there are still many students who do not get KIP (Smart Indonesia Card) scholarships as they should, where this project will help the selection process so that prospective KIP (Smart Indonesia Card) scholarship recipients can be declared eligible or not to receive the scholarship, with the prediction of high school students who want to register themselves to get KIP (Smart Indonesia Card) Scholarships provided by the government. The system is built in the form of an android application with features: detecting students with what kind of economic level deserve the KIP Scholarship (Smart Indonesia Card) by using the machine learning process of classifying photos of student homes and student data.
